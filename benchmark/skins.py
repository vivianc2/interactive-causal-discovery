"""Domain skins for RPG v7 structural sampling.

A skin supplies meaningful, non-leaking names for the roles the sampler needs,
plus a scenario template. The sampler draws a skin, then draws names from its
banks. Names are meaningful (so world knowledge is usable) but which named thing
is the true cause is not implied by the name — that must be learned from data.

Each skin provides pools keyed by ROLE so the same abstract graph can be dressed
in different domains. Pools are deliberately larger than any single world needs.
