"""RPG v7 structural world sampler.

The v6 engine/oracle/audits are structure-agnostic: they operate on any world
dict of the shape {world_id, domain, scenario, scm(WorldSCM), ground_truth}.
v6 only ever *hand-authored* four such dicts. v7 adds a generator that SAMPLES
the structure — chain depth, number of confounders / decoys / distractors, which
mechanism form each edge uses, sign patterns, and which difficulty FEATURES are
present — then dresses it with a domain skin. The existing v6 audits then filter
out any sampled world that is unsolvable, leaky, or not counterintuitive.

This is what makes the benchmark scale in a meaningful sense: not "4 problems ×
seeds" but "unlimited draws from parameterized structural families", each a
genuinely different causal graph, all graded by the same computed oracle.

A sampled world always has this backbone (a confounded mediation chain):

    source_knob --(sign)--> ROOT --hill--> M1 --...--> M_k --linear--> OUTCOME
                                    (PROXY attaches on a mediator, measurable)
    CONFOUNDER --> OUTCOME (weak) and --> DECOY (measurable)   [fake correlation]
    FIX actuator --scale--> ROOT (reduces the true cause; interior-optimum option)
    TRAP actuator --mask--> OUTCOME reading only
    many inert distractor variables + inert control actuators

Optional FEATURES layered on:
  - "sign_flip"     : the source knob helps then hurts (reversal).
  - "interior_dose" : fix has an over-treatment penalty -> best dose interior.
  - "two_cause"     : the root is an AND-gate of two knobs (neither alone works).
  - "symptom_trap"  : include the mask actuator (default on).

# Structural archetypes. Each is a different role-wiring consumed by the SAME
# engine/oracle/audits, so each forces a DIFFERENT scientific-reasoning skill:
#   confounded_chain  : break a confound + trace a mediation chain (the backbone)
#   collider_selection: recognize selection bias -- a decoy correlates with the
#                       outcome ONLY because the historical record is conditioned
#                       on a collider; the correlation vanishes under intervention
#   hidden_subtype    : effect heterogeneity -- a treatment helps one hidden
#                       subgroup and harms the other (population-average ~0), so
#                       the ideal answer is a CONDITIONAL POLICY (stratify on an
#                       observable marker, treat only the subgroup it helps), not
#                       a single dose. Graded by the conditional-policy path.
#   surrogate_trap    : a controllable-but-useless metric -- a measured SURROGATE
#                       correlates with the outcome (shared confounder) and has a
#                       handle that moves it directly, but that handle has ZERO
#                       do-effect on the true outcome. Skill: don't optimize a
#                       surrogate; verify the OUTCOME, not a proxy metric you can
#                       push. (REUSE: confounded decoy + set-handle, sign graded "0".)
#   instrument_only   : the true cause has NO direct handle -- the only lever is the
#                       UPSTREAM source/instrument knob; acting on the cause directly
#                       is impossible, so you must reason back to the instrument.
#                       (REUSE*: structural twist -- the fix actuator is removed.)
#   competing_causes  : TWO independent causes feed the outcome (unequal strength);
#                       neither alone recovers >=90% of the benefit, so you must find
#                       BOTH and not stop at the first. (REUSE: 2nd chain + 2nd fix.)
#   synergy_pair      : two levers that do NOTHING alone but TOGETHER produce a large
#                       effect (AND-gate). Skill: test COMBINATIONS, not one-at-a-time
#                       (a lever inert alone can be essential in combination). REUSE:
#                       the two_cause AND-gate as the core; the oracle's synergy-rescue
#                       pass finds the pair. NB structurally = the two_cause FEATURE ->
#                       for a clean held-out transfer test, exclude the two_cause
#                       feature from TRAINING worlds (or use synergy_pair as train-only).
#   dose_window       : the fix has a THERAPEUTIC WINDOW -- it helps as you reduce the
#                       cause, but OVER-treating past a point harms the outcome, so the
#                       optimum is INTERIOR (both rails fail). Skill: find the sweet
#                       spot, don't max the knob. (REUSE: forces the interior_dose
#                       feature as the central task; oracle golden-section finds it.)
#   confounded_reversal: the treatment's OBSERVATIONAL correlation with the outcome is
#                       the OPPOSITE sign of its true causal effect (a confounder drives
#                       both who-is-treated and the outcome). Skill: don't trust the
#                       observational sign -- INTERVENE; the aggregate can reverse.
#                       (REUSE: reversed-sign source lever; Simpson's / confounding-by-
#                       indication; graded by the interventional sign.)
