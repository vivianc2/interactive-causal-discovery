"""RPG v6 oracle, grader, and audits — over an actuator-combination action space.

Golden search:
  1. screen every actuator's marginal effect at its extreme dose (CRN);
  2. keep the "active" set (|effect| > eps) -- distractors are pruned, which is
     provably safe (see distractor_inertness_audit);
  3. search combinations among active actuators up to size ``max_joint`` with
     golden-section refinement on continuous doses.
