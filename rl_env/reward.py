"""RL reward for RPG — a PURE, DETERMINISTIC function of the policy's id-answer.

Design contract (reward-contract decisions):

- The reward is computed by the SAME oracle_v6.grade() the eval uses, so training and
  evaluation optimize/measure the same thing. (No separate, drift-prone reward logic.)
- The policy answers in OPAQUE IDS (m*/a*, via catalog.py), which we map to canonical
  names here. => NO free-text resolver and NO LLM anywhere in the reward path. The
  reward is a deterministic function of (chosen ids, chosen doses) and the world's
  precomputed gold+battery. This is the RLVR integrity requirement: the same answer
  always earns the same reward, and phrasing cannot change it.
- Dense, continuous shaping so GRPO groups have variance (V3):
      r = w_A * benefit_recovered(partA, clipped to [0,1])
        + w_B * battery_fraction(partB)
        - c_invalid * (fraction of answer ids that were invalid)
      (optionally minus a small over-budget / no-evidence term; off by default)
- Part-B uses strict=True (V5): the exact sampled proxy / valid-equivalent, not a
  lenient downstream set (measured no-op and it weakens the signal).

The answer the policy must emit (all ids from the world's catalog):
    {
      "actions":  [{"actuator": "a3", "value": 66}, ...],         # recommended fix
      "policy":   {"treatment":"a3","stratifier":"m2","threshold":50,   # optional (subtype)
                   "dose_if_ge":100,"dose_if_lt":0},
      "proxy":    "m5",                                            # true_mechanism_proxy
      "decoys":   ["m1","m7"],                                    # confounded_decoys
      "signs":    {"a3": "+", "a0": "0"}                          # actuator sign predictions
    }
Unknown ids are dropped (and counted for the invalid-id penalty), NEVER resolved.
